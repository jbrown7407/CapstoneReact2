User Authentication via backend
Flask for backend
React Router for switching between renders dynamically

<h3>Future Update Ideas:</h3> <br />

Add favorites array for each user

<h3>Difficulty Areas:</h3> <br />
Heroku deployment issues. Server issue related to linux/peewee impacting back-end

I took some inspiration from the original app but cards have a simpler design.

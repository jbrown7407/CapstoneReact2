Tech Stack: <br />
Python, Flask, PostgresQL, React

New Tech: <br />
React-bootstrap - bootstrap library imported into React library
User Authentication via backend
Flask for backend
React Router for switching between renders dynamically

Future Update Ideas: <br />
Link user location to search parameters
Finish user authentication with OAuth or another library
Add favorites array for each user

Difficulty Areas: <br />
Heroku deployment issues. Server issue related to linux/peewee impacting back-end

I took some inspiration from the original app but cards have a simpler design.
